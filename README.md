# Stocks

This project was made as a way for me to practice learning new technologies such as MongoDB and running a Node.js/Express server. 

At first, I wasn't too sure what I wanted to create. So I kind of went along with recreating my Mod 1 Project at Flatiron, this time it'll have a real GUI and authentication!

## Technologies Used
 - React
 - Node.JS
 - MongoDB
 - Express
 - JWT
 
This was one of my first projects after graduating so learning a whole new backend by myself was definitely fun but at the same time confusing.

The main page shows a random stock that allows users to add to their portfolio. It includes a candlestick chart. 

From the searchbar, users can search other stocks and be presented with the same screen.

On the portfolio screen, users are presented with a table of their stocks, change in percentage, and the current price/closing of yesterdays price. If users click the name of the stock they are taken to the presentation page of the stock once again.
